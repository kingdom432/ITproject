	<h1> Computing History</h1>
<p> The history of computing goes far back. Computers are the accumulation of research from hundreds of different scientists from different cultures and different timelines. From the Babylonian abacus to the difference engine “Computers" took many different forms before they became what we know them as.</p>

 <p>
The first computers were used purely for the sake of mathematical calculations to cut out the busy work of making basic math operations in preparation for the more advanced calculations. The abacus, for example, was used as a counting machine for early Babylonian Scholars between 2,700 BC and 300 BC. It was used as a way to input numbers and very easily subtract and add them using physical instruments. It isn’t much to the people of today but it was a strong and reliable start until technology advanced.

Talking about mathematics and numbers might seem far from the computers of today but they are very intrinsically linked. Computing itself is possible due to mathematics and people’s insane love of numbers and the power they hold.
