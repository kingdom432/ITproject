<h1>About us</h1>
<p>Comp_Lovers is a company that talks all things computer science, ranging from its history within our society all the way to its future in our society and everything in between. Our company is here to inform newcomers about what computer science is, and how beneficial it can be. Our company is “noob” friendly and welcomes everyone. Our goal as a company is to spread awareness and knowledge of computer science to as many people as possible. We also have many coders as employers, who will also be on the website, actively checking any questions or concerns.
