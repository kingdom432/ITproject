<p>After looking at the history of computer science and all the people that eventually brought it to what it is today, you can appreciate how far it's come from old men using abacuses to giant supercomputers that dominate society and control so many things like agriculture, weaponry, entertainment, EVERYTHING in society is controlled by the computing technology that these great men and woman and many more helped create.</p>
<br />

<p>
One MASSIVE creation of computer science is AI. Artificial intelligence is something straight out of a sci-fi movie like the Terminator. It's a technology that has exploded in recent times with the introduction of ChatGPT, bringing it to the public consciousness for the regular folk.  From calculators to machines that can make music and do all sort of things the potential of technology is nearly infinite, the only question is how youâ€™ll contribute to that bright future?
