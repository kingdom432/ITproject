 <br/>


<p>Born in 1956, in the Netherlands is a programmer who graduated with his master's degree in 1982 in mathematics and computer science from the University of Amsterdam. He spent his life as a programmer, first in the Netherlands then moved to the U.S. and worked at NIST( National Institute of Standards Technology), CNRI(Corporation For National Research Initiatives), Google, and since 2013 is working at Dropbox. 
Throughout this time he created and maintained the well-known program known as Python. Python is an easy and intuitive programming language, allowing anyone to contribute to it because it is open source. This program was released in 1991, and then Guido decided it should be open source, understandable as plain English, and suitable for everyday tasks. These changes were made in 1999, and haven’t changed to this day; Python is used in machine learning
banking, education, math, engineering, etc. Guido has taken the title of being the “Benevolent Dictator For Life” from the Python user community.
