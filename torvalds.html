      <h1>Linus Torvalds</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;" >
      Linus Torvalds is another highly influential figure in the world of computing, primarily known for initiating the development of the Linux kernel. Born on December 28, 1969, in Helsinki, Finland, Torvalds displayed a strong interest in computers from a young age. He attended the University of Helsinki, where he was drawn to operating systems and, specifically, the UNIX operating system.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Torvalds' most significant contribution began in 1991, while he was still a student. Dissatisfied with the existing operating systems available to him, especially the limited academic licensing of MINIX (a UNIX-like system), he started to develop his own operating system kernel, which he initially named “Freax.” This kernel was later renamed “Linux,” a portmanteau of “Linus” and “UNIX.” Linux was unique in that Torvalds made its source code available for free to anyone who wanted to use or modify it. This open-source approach was a stark contrast to the proprietary nature of software development at the time and laid the foundation for what would become the Linux operating system.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">The impact of Torvalds’ work on Linux cannot be overstated. Linux has grown from a small, personal project into one of the most pervasive operating systems in the world. It is used extensively in servers, embedded systems, and even forms the basis of the Android operating system, which powers the majority of smartphones today. Beyond the technical achievements, Torvalds' commitment to open-source software has influenced the development of software and technology, promoting a collaborative approach to software development that encourages sharing, modification, and improvement by a global community of developers. His work and philosophy have fundamentally shaped the software industry, making technology more accessible and customizable for users and developers worldwide.</p>
