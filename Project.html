	<h1> Computing History</h1>
<p> The history of computing goes far back. Computers are the accumulation of research from hundreds of different scientists from different cultures and different timelines. From the Babylonian abacus to the difference engine “Computers" took many different forms before they became what we know them as.</p>

The first computers were used purely for the sake of mathematical calculations to cut out the busy work of making basic math operations in preparation for the more advanced calculations. The abacus, for example, was used as a counting machine for early Babylonian Scholars between 2,700 BC and 300 BC. It was used as a way to input numbers and very easily subtract and add them using physical instruments. It isn’t much to the people of today but it was a strong and reliable start until technology advanced.

Charles Babbage was another huge milestone in the journey of computer science, he was a masterful mathematician who had created the concept of an advanced calculator called the analytical engine. This analytical tool was different from any predecessors in that it could store previous outputs in its “memory” to later be used for other calculations. Although he conceptulized the analytical engine he himself only saw it as a calculator.<br></br>

Ada Lovelace was the true visionary and the worlds first computer programmer. She was a personal friend of Babbage and was a mathematical genius in every sense of the word. The “enchantress of number” as Babbage liked to call her, had a great interest in Babbage’s analytical engine. She famously took notes from a speech he gave about his engine, republished them with her own notes that were 3x as long as the original transcript. Within those notes she hypothezied the potential of his engine stating it could make music. Long before the age of electricity she eamined a glorified calculator and saw the potential within.
